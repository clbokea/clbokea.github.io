Crime incidents related to prostitution in San Francisco have decreased over the period from 2003 to 2017, with significant drops occurring at certain points during this period. What has caused this decline? Has one of human's basic needs disappeared? Has the fear of the consequences of engaging in prostitution increased, or has human nature found alternative means to fulfill its desires? 

Let's take a look under the covers of the [recorded crime data](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data) in San Francisco in the years 2003-2007 to see if it can offer insights into this mystery. Perhaps it may even reveal hotspots for prostitution, should you find yourself in this need in the future.
