Crime incidents related to prostitution in San Francisco have decreased over the period from 2003 to 2017. Particularly, there have been significant drops at certain points during this period. Why has this occurred, and can the [data](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data) provide us with insights into what works and what doesn't in the fight against prostitution?

<small>Dataset used in this article: [Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data)</small>
