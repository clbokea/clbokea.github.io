Crime incidents related to prostitution in San Francisco have decreased over the period from 2003 to 2017, with significant drops occurring at certain points during this period. What has caused this decline? Has one of human's basic needs disappeared? Has the fear of the consequences of engaging in prostitution increased, or has human nature found alternative means to fulfill its desires? Can [data](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data) offer us insights into this mystery and perhaps reveal effective strategies in the fight against prostitution?
