Prostitution incidents in San Francisco saw a substantial decrease from 2003 to 2005, with numbers dropping by nearly half. However, the figures returned to their former levels by 2007. Since then, there has been a steady decrease in incidents, culminating in approximately 500 incidents per year by the end of 2017, which represents a reduction of almost two-thirds from the 2007 figures. 

Examining the four most prominent subcategories of prostitution, we observe that 'Solicits for act of prostitution' (meaning the direct act of bying or selling sex) appears to mirror the overall trend, while 'Human trafficking' has increased slightly from no records prior to 2009 towards the end of 2017. 

California, and especially San Francisco, is the area in the United States, that has the highest rates of human trafficking. [Several initiatives](https://humantraffickingfront.org/human-trafficking-in-california-complete-prevention-guide/) has been taken to reduce these numbers, therefore the crime rates might not mirror that more human trafficking have been commited, but rather, that more cases have been uncovered and penalized. 

From 2009 to 2010, 'Solicits to visit house of prostitution' decreased dramatically from around 900 incidents per year to nearly none in the subsequent years. In contrast, 'Loitering for purpose of prostitution' ([meaning](https://decriminalizesex.work/why-decriminalization/briefing-papers/loitering-for-the-purpose-of-prostitution-lpp/): _wandering, remaining, or spending time in a public space1 with the intention of committing a prostitution offense or promoting prostitution_) spiked from zero to 750 incidents in 2010. Whether lotering is a crime in itself has been a topic of discussion over the years, and it could seem as the police departments started recording it as a crime around 2010, while a new law in 2023 has once again [decriminalized loitering](https://localnewsmatters.org/2023/08/17/sex-work-and-the-city-policing-prostitution-in-san-francisco-reflects-evolving-attitudes/). Alas, it should be safe for now to wander in the streets with intentions, without commiting a crime.

The most striking discrepancies are evident in the two divergent trends of 'Solicits to visit house of prostitution' and 'Loitering for purpose of prostitution'.
