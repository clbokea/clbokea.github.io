Prostitution incidents in San Francisco saw a substantial decrease from 2003 to 2005, with numbers dropping by nearly half. However, the figures returned to their former levels by 2007. Since then, there has been a steady decrease in incidents, culminating in approximately 500 incidents per year by the end of 2017, which represents a reduction of almost two-thirds from the 2007 figures. 

Examining the four most prominent subcategories of prostitution, we observe that 'Solicits for act of prostitution' appears to mirror the overall trend, while 'Human trafficking' has increased slightly from no records prior to 2009 towards the end of 2017. 

From 2009 to 2010, 'Solicits to visit house of prostitution' decreased dramatically from around 900 incidents per year to nearly none in the subsequent years. In contrast, 'Loitering for purpose of prostitution' spiked from zero to 750 incidents in 2010. 

The most striking discrepancies are evident in the two divergent trends of 'Solicits to visit house of prostitution' and 'Loitering for purpose of prostitution'.
