Prostitution incidents in San Francisco experienced a significant decrease from 2003 to 2005, dropping by nearly half. However, the numbers rebounded to their previous levels in 2007. Since then, there has been a consistent decline in incidents where we in the end of 2017 had around 500 insidents a year, a drop of almost 2/3 of the 2007 levels. If we look at the 4 most prominent subcategories of prostetution we see that "Solicits for act of prostitution" seams to follow the overall trends, and that "Human trafficking" comes from a low incident count to a slightly increasing towards the end of 2017. From 2009 to 2010 "Solicits to visit house of prostitution" drops from around 900 incidents a year to close to nothing the following years. Opposite to that "Loitering for purpose of prostitution" increases from 0 to 750 incidents a year in 2010. The most significant outliers can be found in the 2 opposite trends of "Solicits to visit house of prostitution" and "Loitering for purpose of prostitution".
