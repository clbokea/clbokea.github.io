Zooming into the streets of San Francisco, we see a detailed map of development of various prostitution incidents from 2003 to 2017 and which street corners they occurred in the San Francisco area. As expected from the previous map, we see clustering of prostitution incidents in the central districts of San Francisco. 

Beware, that while you might see a fall of prostituion crime in the San Francisco area, this might not mean the same amount of decrease of actual sexual trades and offers, as there are taken several actions to decriminalize prostitution. [Prostitution K](https://www.spur.org/publications/voter-guide/2008-11-01/proposition-k-decriminalizing-prostitution), fighting for PROstitution rights, might be the reason for the fall in crime data in 2007 and forward.

If you are visiting San Francisco, take a look at the map, and sorting the results accordingly by type of prostitution incident. This might provide you with inspiration for which areas to avoid and which areas to pursue, depending on your needs and interests. 

And don't forget, that the online era might also have an influence on the decrease in street prostitution, as more customers find their way to a digital mistress, no longer loitering in the streets.
