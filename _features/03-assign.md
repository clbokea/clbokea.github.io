You might find yourself wondering, where in San Francisco is prostitution most common? Let's first take a look at map of the districts of the city and the density of prostitution incidents for each district. 

The map shows the data in normalized form, meaning that the number of incidents for each district is divided by the area of the district. This provides a more realistic overview of where prostitution crime incidents are most dense.

Looking at this map, we see that prostitution is most common in the Tenderloin district, followed by the Mission, Northern, and Central districts.
